# Aurora_SDD 1.1.Control Structures

In github create a simple kanban style project for this repo (this may have come across with the template)

For each of the sub-programs (functions) in helpers.py
- create an issue describing the task (use the docstring of the function as a guide)
- add a pseudocode algorithm for the sub-program in `docs/helpers.pseudo`
- write a test for the sub-program in `test_helpers.py`
- edit the sub-program in `helpers.py` until it passes the test
- mark your issue as done and notify your teacher

Read the [wiki notes on counted repetition](https://github.com/AuroraCollegeSDD/12SDD20_Course_Information/wiki/9.2.3-Implementation-of-software-solution) for more information.

For one of the subprograms create a flowchart in [diagrams.net](https://www.diagrams.net/)
