# Aurora_SDD 1.1.Control Structures

In addition to learning learning about control structures, we are going to use this project to re-familiarise yourselves with workflows and project management in github.

 - In github create a simple kanban style project for this repo (this may have come across with the template)

- For each of the sub-programs (functions) in helpers.py
    - create a github issue in your project describing the task (use the docstring of the function as a guide)
    - create a branch, using the sub-program name.
    - add a pseudocode algorithm for the sub-program in `docs/helpers.pseudo`
    - write a test for the sub-program in `test_helpers.py`
    - edit the sub-program in `helpers.py` until it passes the test
    - mark your issue as done, create a pull request and and notify your teacher so that your work can be checked before it is merged back with the main branch

Read the [wiki notes on control structures](https://github.com/2022AC12SDD/Course_Information/wiki/9.2.3-Implementation-of-software-solution#control-structures) for more information.

For one of the subprograms create a flowchart in [diagrams.net](https://www.diagrams.net/) and add it to the `docs/` folder
